While Mary's cousin, Elizabeth, hesitates over signing Mary's death sentence, Mary hopes for a reprieve.\\nAfter Mary finds out that Mortimer (created by Schiller), the nephew of her custodian, is on her side, she entrusts her life to him. Mortimer is supposed to give Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, a letter from Mary, in which she pleads for help. This is a delicate situation, for Leicester seems to support Queen Elizabeth.\\nAfter numerous requests, Mary finally gains the opportunity to meet Queen Elizabeth (something that, in reality, never happened). This meeting ends in an acrimonious argument, caused by Mary's unwillingness to submit entirely to Elizabeth's wish. The argument leads to the inevitable suspicion that the cause of reprieve will not succeed.\\nTo complicate matters further, Mortimer plans to free Mary from the prison by force, a dramatized version of the unsuccessful Babington Plot, but when his attempt is found out, he commits suicide.\\nQueen Elizabeth eventually persuades herself to sign Mary's death warrant. Elizabeth insists that her only reason for signing is the pressure from her own people to do so.\\nThe signed warrant is handed to Queen Elizabeth's undersecretary Davison without any clear instructions on what to do with it. In the process, Elizabeth transfers the burden of responsibility to him, fully aware that he in turn will hand over the warrant to Lord Burleigh, and thus confirm Mary's death sentence.\\nBurleigh demands the signed document from Davison, who â\\x80\\x94 despite his uncertainty â\\x80\\x94 eventually hands it to him. As a result, Burleigh has Mary executed.\\nThe play ends with Elizabeth blaming both Burleigh and Davison for Mary's death (banishing the former from court and having the latter imprisoned in the Tower), Lord Shrewsbury (who pleaded for mercy for Mary throughout the play) resigning his honors and Leicester leaving England for France. Elizabeth is left completely alone as the curtain falls.\", 'tokens': array(['Mary', 'Stuart', 'is', 'imprisoned', 'in', 'England', 'â\\x80\\x94',\n",

These are distinguished by brackets. On\\nthe other hand, Mr. Mellish omitted many passages which now form part of\\nthe printed drama, all of which are now added. The translation, as a\\nwhole, stands out from similar works of the time (1800) in almost as\\nmarked a degree as Coleridge\\'s Wallenstein, and some passages exhibit\\npowers of a high order; a few, however, especially in the earlier\\nscenes, seemed capable of improvement, and these have been revised,\\nbut, in deference to the translator, with a sparing hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE.\\n\\nELIZABETH, Queen of England.\\nMARY STUART, Queen of Scots, a Prisoner in England.\\nROBERT DUDLEY, Earl of Leicester.\\nGEORGE TALBOT, Earl of Shrewsbury.\\nWILLIAM CECIL, Lord Burleigh, Lord High Treasurer.\\nEARL OF KENT.\\nSIR WILLIAM DAVISON, Secretary of State.\\nSIR AMIAS PAULET, Keeper of MARY.\\nSIR EDWARD MORTIMER, his Nephew.\\nCOUNT L\\'AUBESPINE, the French Ambassador.\\nO\\'KELLY, Mortimer\\'s Friend.\\nCOUNT BELLIEVRE, Envoy Extraordinary from France.\\nSIR DRUE DRURY, another Keeper of MARY.\\nSIR ANDREW MELVIL, her House Steward.\\nBURGOYNE, her Physician.\\nHANNAH KENNEDY, her Nurse.\\nMARGARET CURL, her Attendant.\\nSheriff of the County.\\nOfficer of the Guard.\\nFrench and English Lords.\\nSoldiers.\\nServants of State belonging to ELIZABETH.\\nServants and Female Attendants of the Queen of Scots.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT I.\\n\\nSCENE I.\\n\\n   A common apartment in the Castle of Fotheringay.\\n\\n   HANNAH KENNEDY, contending violently with PAULET, who is about\\n   to break open a closet; DRURY with an iron crown.\\n\\nKENNEDY.\\nHow now, sir? what fresh outrage have we here?\\nBack from that cabinet!\\n\\nPAULET.\\n             Whence came the jewel?\\nI know \\'twas from an upper chamber thrown;\\nAnd you would bribe the gardener with your trinkets.\\nA curse on woman\\'s wiles!

Did she not rouse\\nFrom out these walls the malefactor Parry,\\nAnd Babington, to the detested crime\\nOf regicide?

Because she trusts to wiles,\\nAnd treacherous arts of base conspiracy;\\nAnd, hourly plotting schemes of mischief, hopes\\nTo conquer, from her prison, all this isle.\\n\\nKENNEDY.\\nYou mock us, sir, and edge your cruelty\\nWith words of bitter scorn:--that she should form\\nSuch projects; she, who\\'s here immured alive,\\nTo whom no sound of comfort, not a voice\\nOf friendship comes from her beloved home;\\nWho hath so long no human face beheld,\\nSave her stern gaoler\\'s unrelenting brows;\\nTill now, of late, in your uncourteous cousin\\nShe sees a second keeper, and beholds\\nFresh bolts and bars against her multiplied.\\n\\nPAULET.\\nNo iron-grate is proof against her wiles.\\nHow do I know these bars are not filed through?\\nHow that this floor, these walls, that seem so strong\\nWithout, may not be hollow from within,\\nAnd let in felon treachery when I sleep?\\nAccursed office, that\\'s intrusted to me,\\nTo guard this cunning mother of all ill!\\nFear scares me from my sleep; and in the night\\nI, like a troubled spirit, roam and try\\nThe strength of every bolt, and put to proof\\nEach guard\\'s fidelity:--I see, with fear,\\nThe dawning of each morn, which may confirm\\nMy apprehensions:--yet, thank God, there\\'s hope\\nThat all my fears will soon be at an end;\\nFor rather would I at the gates of hell\\nStand sentinel, and guard the devilish host\\nOf damned souls, than this deceitful queen.\\n\\nKENNEDY.\\nHere comes the queen.\\n\\nPAULET.\\n            Christ\\'s image in her hand.\\nPride, and all worldly lusts within her heart.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCENE II.\\n\\n   The same. Enter MARY, veiled, a crucifix in her hand.\\n\\nKENNEDY (hastening toward her).\\nO gracious queen! they tread us under foot;\\nNo end of tyranny and base oppression;\\nEach coming day heaps fresh indignities,\\nNew sufferings on thy royal head.\\n\\nMARY.\\n                  Be calm--\\nSay, what has happened?\\n\\nKENNEDY.\\n             See! thy cabinet\\nIs forced--thy papers--and thy only treasure,\\nWhich with such pains we had secured, the last\\nPoor remnant of thy bridal ornaments\\nFrom France, is in his hands--naught now remains\\nOf royal state--thou art indeed bereft!\\n\\nMARY.\\nCompose yourself, my Hannah! and believe me,\\n\\'Tis not these baubles that can make a queen--\\nBasely indeed they may behave to us,\\nBut they cannot debase us. I have learned\\nTo use myself to many a change in England;\\nI can support this too. Sir, you have taken\\nBy force what I this very day designed\\nTo have delivered to you. There\\'s a letter\\nAmongst these papers for my royal sister\\nOf England. Pledge me, sir, your word of honor,\\nTo give it to her majesty\\'s own hands,\\nAnd not to the deceitful care of Burleigh.\\n\\nPAULET.\\nI shall consider what is best to do.\\n\\nMARY.\\nSir, you shall know its import. In this letter\\nI beg a favor, a great favor of her,--\\nThat she herself will give me audience,--she\\nWhom I have never seen. I have been summoned\\nBefore a court of men, whom I can ne\\'er\\nAcknowledge as my peers--of men to whom\\nMy heart denies its confidence. The queen\\nIs of my family, my rank, my sex;\\nTo her alone--a sister, queen, and woman--\\nCan I unfold my heart.\\n\\nPAULET.\\n            Too oft, my lady,\\nHave you intrusted both your fate and honor\\nTo men less worthy your esteem than these.\\n\\nMARY.\\nI, in the letter, beg another favor,\\nAnd surely naught but inhumanity\\nCan here reject my prayer. These many years\\nHave I, in prison, missed the church\\'s comfort,\\nThe blessings of the sacraments--and she\\nWho robs me of my freedom and my crown,\\nWho seeks my very life, can never wish\\nTo shut the gates of heaven upon my soul.\\n\\nPAULET.\\nWhene\\'er you wish, the dean shall wait upon you.\\n\\nMARY (interrupting him sharply).\\nTalk to me not of deans. I ask the aid\\nOf one of my own church--a Catholic priest.\\n\\nPAULET.\\n[That is against the published laws of England.\\n\\nMARY.\\nThe laws of England are no rule for me.\\nI am not England\\'s subject; I have ne\\'er\\nConsented to its laws, and will not bow\\nBefore their cruel and despotic sway.\\nIf \\'tis your will, to the unheard-of rigor\\nWhich I have borne, to add this new oppression,\\nI must submit to what your power ordains;\\nYet will I raise my voice in loud complaints.]\\nI also wish a public notary,\\nAnd secretaries, to prepare my will--\\nMy sorrows and my prison\\'s wretchedness\\nPrey on my life--my days, I fear, are numbered--\\nI feel that I am near the gates of death.\\n\\nPAULET.\\nThese serious contemplations well become you.\\n\\nMARY.\\nAnd know I then that some too ready hand\\nMay not abridge this tedious work of sorrow?\\nI would indite my will and make disposal\\nOf what belongs to me.\\n\\nPAULET.\\n            This liberty\\nMay be allowed to you, for England\\'s queen\\nWill not enrich herself by plundering you.\\n\\nMARY.\\nI have been parted from my faithful women,\\nAnd from my servants; tell me, where are they?\\nWhat is their fate? I can indeed dispense\\nAt present with their service, but my heart\\nWill feel rejoiced to know these faithful ones\\nAre not exposed to suffering and to want!\\n\\nPAULET.\\nYour servants have been cared for; [and again\\nYou shall behold whate\\'er is taken from you\\nAnd all shall be restored in proper season.]\\n\\n                 [Going.\\n\\nMARY.\\nAnd will you leave my presence thus again,\\nAnd not relieve my fearful, anxious heart\\nFrom the fell torments of uncertainty?\\nThanks to the vigilance of your hateful spies,\\nI am divided from the world; no voice\\nCan reach me through these prison-walls; my fate\\nLies in the hands of those who wish my ruin.\\nA month of dread suspense is passed already\\nSince when the forty high commissioners\\nSurprised me in this castle, and erected,\\nWith most unseemly haste, their dread tribunal;\\nThey forced me, stunned, amazed, and unprepared,\\nWithout an advocate, from memory,\\nBefore their unexampled court, to answer\\nTheir weighty charges, artfully arranged.\\nThey came like ghosts,--like ghosts they disappeared,\\nAnd since that day all mouths are closed to me.\\nIn vain I seek to construe from your looks\\nWhich hath prevailed--my cause\\'s innocence\\nAnd my friends\\' zeal--or my foes\\' cursed counsel.\\nOh, break this silence! let me know the worst;\\nWhat have I still to fear, and what to hope.\\n\\nPAULET.\\nClose your accounts with heaven.\\n\\nMARY.\\n                 From heaven I hope\\nFor mercy, sir; and from my earthly judges\\nI hope, and still expect, the strictest justice.\\n\\nPAULET.\\nJustice, depend upon it, will be done you.\\n\\nMARY.\\nIs the suit ended, sir?\\n\\nPAULET.\\n             I cannot tell.\\n\\nMARY.\\nAm I condemned?\\n\\nPAULET.\\n         I cannot answer, lady.\\n\\nMARY.\\n[Sir, a good work fears not the light of day.\\n\\nPAULET.\\nThe day will shine upon it, doubt it not.]\\n\\nMARY.\\nDespatch is here the fashion. Is it meant\\nThe murderer shall surprise me, like the judges?\\n\\nPAULET.\\nStill entertain that thought and he will find you\\nBetter prepared to meet your fate than they did.\\n\\nMARY (after a pause).\\nSir, nothing can surprise me which a court\\nInspired by Burleigh\\'s hate and Hatton\\'s zeal,\\nHowe\\'er unjust, may venture to pronounce:\\nBut I have yet to learn how far the queen\\nWill dare in execution of the sentence.\\n\\nPAULET.\\nThe sovereigns of England have no fear\\nBut for their conscience and their parliament.\\nWhat justice hath decreed her fearless hand\\nWill execute before the assembled world.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCENE III.\\n\\n   The same. MORTIMER enters, and without paying attention\\n   to the QUEEN, addresses PAULET.\\n\\nMORTIMER.\\nUncle, you\\'re sought for.\\n\\n   [He retires in the same manner. The QUEEN remarks it, and\\n   turns towards PAULET, who is about to follow him.\\n\\nMARY.\\n              Sir, one favor more\\nIf you have aught to say to me--from you\\nI can bear much--I reverence your gray hairs;\\nBut cannot bear that young man\\'s insolence;\\nSpare me in future his unmannered rudeness.\\n\\nPAULET.\\nI prize him most for that which makes you hate him\\nHe is not, truly, one of those poor fools\\nWho melt before a woman\\'s treacherous tears.\\nHe has seen much--has been to Rheims and Paris,\\nAnd brings us back his true old English heart.\\nLady, your cunning arts are lost on him.\\n\\n                   [Exit.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCENE IV.\\n\\n   MARY, KENNEDY.\\n\\nKENNEDY.\\nAnd dare the ruffian venture to your face\\nSuch language! Oh, \\'tis hard--\\'tis past endurance.\\n\\nMARY (lost in reflection).\\nIn the fair moments of our former splendor\\nWe lent to flatterers a too willing ear;--\\nIt is but just, good Hannah, we should now\\nBe forced to hear the bitter voice of censure.\\n\\nKENNEDY.\\nSo downcast, so depressed, my dearest lady!\\nYou, who before so gay, so full of hope,\\nWere used to comfort me in my distress;\\nMore gracious were the task to check your mirth\\nThan chide your heavy sadness.\\n\\nMARY.\\n                Well I know him--\\nIt is the bleeding Darnley\\'s royal shade,\\nRising in anger from his darksome grave\\nAnd never will he make his peace with me\\nUntil the measures of my woes be full.\\n\\nKENNEDY.\\nWhat thoughts are these--\\n\\nMARY.\\n             Thou may\\'st forget it, Hannah;\\nBut I\\'ve a faithful memory--\\'tis this day\\nAnother wretched anniversary\\nOf that regretted, that unhappy deed--\\nWhich I must celebrate with fast and penance.\\n\\nKENNEDY.\\nDismiss at length in peace this evil spirit.\\nThe penitence of many a heavy year,\\nOf many a suffering, has atoned the deed;\\nThe church, which holds the key of absolution,\\nPardons the crime, and heaven itself\\'s appeased.\\n\\nMARY.\\nThis long-atoned crime arises fresh\\nAnd bleeding from its lightly-covered grave;\\nMy husband\\'s restless spirit seeks revenge;\\nNo sacred bell can exorcise, no host\\nIn priestly hands dismiss it to his tomb.\\n\\nKENNEDY.\\nYou did not murder him; \\'twas done by others.\\n\\nMARY.\\nBut it was known to me; I suffered it,\\nAnd lured him with my smiles to death\\'s embrace.\\n\\nKENNEDY.\\nYour youth extenuates your guilt. You were\\nOf tender years.\\n\\nMARY.\\n         So tender, yet I drew\\nThis heavy guilt upon my youthful head.\\n\\nKENNEDY.\\nYou were provoked by direst injuries,\\nAnd by the rude presumption of the man,\\nWhom out of darkness, like the hand of heaven,\\nYour love drew forth, and raised above all others.\\nWhom through your bridal chamber you conducted\\nUp to your throne, and with your lovely self,\\nAnd your hereditary crown, distinguished\\n[Your work was his existence, and your grace\\nBedewed him like the gentle rains of heaven.]\\nCould he forget that his so splendid lot\\nWas the creation of your generous love?\\nYet did he, worthless as he was, forget it.\\nWith base suspicions, and with brutal manners,\\nHe wearied your affections, and became\\nAn object to you of deserved disgust:\\nThe illusion, which till now had overcast\\nYour judgment, vanished; angrily you fled\\nHis foul embrace, and gave him up to scorn.\\nAnd did he seek again to win your love?\\nYour favor? Did he e\\'er implore your pardon?\\nOr fall in deep repentance at your feet?\\nNo; the base wretch defied you; he, who was\\nYour bounty\\'s creature, wished to play your king,\\n[And strove, through fear, to force your inclination.]\\nBefore your eyes he had your favorite singer,\\nPoor Rizzio, murdered; you did but avenge\\nWith blood the bloody deed----\\n\\nMARY.\\n               And bloodily,\\nI fear, too soon \\'twill be avenged on me:\\nYou seek to comfort me, and you condemn me.\\n\\nKENNEDY.\\nYou were, when you consented to this deed,\\nNo more yourself; belonged not to yourself;\\nThe madness of a frantic love possessed you,\\nAnd bound you to a terrible seducer,\\nThe wretched Bothwell. That despotic man\\nRuled you with shameful, overbearing will,\\nAnd with his philters and his hellish arts\\nInflamed your passions.\\n\\nMARY.\\n             All the arts he used\\nWere man\\'s superior strength and woman\\'s weakness.\\n\\nKENNEDY.\\nNo, no, I say. The most pernicious spirits\\nOf hell he must have summoned to his aid,\\nTo cast this mist before your waking senses.\\nYour ear no more was open to the voice\\nOf friendly warning, and your eyes were shut\\nTo decency; soft female bashfulness\\nDeserted you; those cheeks, which were before\\nThe seat of virtuous, blushing modesty,\\nGlowed with the flames of unrestrained desire.\\nYou cast away the veil of secrecy,\\nAnd the flagitious daring of the man\\nO\\'ercame your natural coyness: you exposed\\nYour shame, unblushingly, to public gaze:\\nYou let the murderer, whom the people followed\\nWith curses, through the streets of Edinburgh,\\nBefore you bear the royal sword of Scotland\\nIn triumph. You begirt your parliament\\nWith armed bands; and by this shameless farce,\\nThere, in the very temple of great justice,\\nYou forced the judges of the land to clear\\nThe murderer of his guilt. You went still further--\\nO God!\\n\\nMARY.\\n    Conclude--nay, pause not--say for this\\nI gave my hand in marriage at the altar.\\n\\nKENNEDY.\\nO let an everlasting silence veil\\nThat dreadful deed: the heart revolts at it.\\nA crime to stain the darkest criminal!\\nYet you are no such lost one, that I know.\\nI nursed your youth myself--your heart is framed\\nFor tender softness: \\'tis alive to shame,\\nAnd all your fault is thoughtless levity.\\nYes, I repeat it, there are evil spirits,\\nWho sudden fix in man\\'s unguarded breast\\nTheir fatal residence, and there delight\\nTo act their dev\\'lish deeds; then hurry back\\nUnto their native hell, and leave behind\\nRemorse and horror in the poisoned bosom.\\nSince this misdeed, which blackens thus your life,\\nYou have done nothing ill; your conduct has\\nBeen pure; myself can witness your amendment.\\nTake courage, then; with your own heart make peace.\\nWhatever cause you have for penitence,\\nYou are not guilty here. Nor England\\'s queen,\\nNor England\\'s parliament can be your judge.\\nHere might oppresses you: you may present\\nYourself before this self-created court\\nWith all the fortitude of innocence.\\n\\nMARY.\\nI hear a step.\\n\\nKENNEDY.\\n        It is the nephew--In.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCENE V.\\n\\n   The same.

Is there no delusion\\nTo cheat my senses? Do I find a friend\\nSo near, when I conceived myself abandoned\\nBy the whole world?

What was my wonder,\\nAs the magnificence of stately columns\\nRushed on my sight! the vast triumphal arches,\\nThe Colosseum\\'s grandeur, with amazement\\nStruck my admiring senses; the sublime\\nCreative spirit held my soul a prisoner\\nIn the fair world of wonders it had framed.\\nI ne\\'er had felt the power of art till now.\\nThe church that reared me hates the charms of sense;\\nIt tolerates no image, it adores\\nBut the unseen, the incorporeal word.\\nWhat were my feelings, then, as I approached\\nThe threshold of the churches, and within,\\nHeard heavenly music floating in the air:\\nWhile from the walls and high-wrought roofs there streamed\\nCrowds of celestial forms in endless train--\\nWhen the Most High, Most Glorious pervaded\\nMy captivated sense in real presence!\\nAnd when I saw the great and godlike visions,\\nThe Salutation, the Nativity,\\nThe Holy Mother, and the Trinity\\'s\\nDescent, the luminous transfiguration\\nAnd last the holy pontiff, clad in all\\nThe glory of his office, bless the people!\\nOh! what is all the pomp of gold and jewels\\nWith which the kings of earth adorn themselves!\\nHe is alone surrounded by the Godhead;\\nHis mansion is in truth an heavenly kingdom,\\nFor not of earthly moulding are these forms!\\n\\nMARY.\\nO spare me, sir! No further. Spread no more\\nLife\\'s verdant carpet out before my eyes,\\nRemember I am wretched, and a prisoner.\\n\\nMORTIMER.\\nI was a prisoner, too, my queen; but swift\\nMy prison-gates flew open, when at once\\nMy spirit felt its liberty, and hailed\\nThe smiling dawn of life. I learned to burst\\nEach narrow prejudice of education,\\nTo crown my brow with never-fading wreaths,\\nAnd mix my joy with the rejoicing crowd.\\nFull many noble Scots, who saw my zeal,\\nEncouraged me, and with the gallant French\\nThey kindly led me to your princely uncle,\\nThe Cardinal of Guise. Oh, what a man!\\nHow firm, how clear, how manly, and how great!\\nBorn to control the human mind at will!\\nThe very model of a royal priest;\\nA ruler of the church without an equal!\\n\\nMARY.\\nYou\\'ve seen him then,--the much loved, honored man,\\nWho was the guardian of my tender years!\\nOh, speak of him!

PAULET and DRURY,\\n   also in mourning, enter, followed by many servants,\\n   who bear golden and silver vessels, mirrors, paintings,\\n   and other valuables, and fill the back part of the stage\\n   with them. PAULET delivers to the NURSE a box of jewels\\n   and a paper, and seems to inform her by signs that it\\n   contains the inventory of the effects the QUEEN had brought\\n   with her. At the sight of these riches, the anguish of\\n   the NURSE is renewed; she sinks into a deep, glowing\\n   melancholy, during which DRURY, PAULET, and the servants\\n   silently retire.\\n\\n   MELVIL enters.\\n\\nKENNEDY (screams aloud as soon as she observes him).\\nMelvil!

With frantic looks,\\nWith hair dishevelled, on his pallet lay\\nThe Scot like one tormented by a fury.\\nThe miserable man no sooner saw me\\nThan at my feet he fell, and there, with screams,\\nClasping my knees, and writhing like a worm,\\nImplored, conjured me to acquaint him with\\nHis sovereign\\'s destiny, for vague reports\\nHad somehow reached the dungeons of the Tower\\nThat she had been condemned to suffer death.\\nWhen I confirmed these tidings, adding, too,\\nThat on his evidence she had been doomed,--\\nHe started wildly up,--caught by the throat\\nHis fellow-prisoner; with the giant strength\\nOf madness tore him to the ground and tried\\nTo strangle him. No sooner had we saved\\nThe wretch from his fierce grapple than at once\\nHe turned his rage against himself and beat\\nHis breast with savage fists; then cursed himself\\nAnd his companions to the depths of hell!\\nHis evidence was false; the fatal letters\\nTo Babington, which he had sworn were true,\\nHe now denounced as forgeries; for he\\nHad set down words the queen had never spoken;\\nThe traitor Nau had led him to this treason.\\nThen ran he to the casement, threw it wide\\nWith frantic force, and cried into the street\\nSo loud that all the people gathered round:\\nI am the man, Queen Mary\\'s secretary,\\nThe traitor who accused his mistress falsely;\\nI bore false witness and am cursed forever!\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\nYou said yourself that he had lost his wits;\\nA madman\\'s words prove nothing.\\n\\nSHREWSBURY.\\n                 Yet this madness\\nServes in itself to swell the proof.

It exists\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\npeople in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\n\\n\\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n'}\n"

      "{'text': \" Mary Stuart is imprisoned in England â\\x80\\x94 nominally for the murder of her husband Darnley, but actually due to her claim to the throne of England held by Queen Elizabeth I. While Mary's cousin, Elizabeth, hesitates over signing Mary's death sentence, Mary hopes for a reprieve.\\nAfter Mary finds out that Mortimer (created by Schiller), the nephew of her custodian, is on her side, she entrusts her life to him. Mortimer is supposed to give Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, a letter from Mary, in which she pleads for help. This is a delicate situation, for Leicester seems to support Queen Elizabeth.\\nAfter numerous requests, Mary finally gains the opportunity to meet Queen Elizabeth (something that, in reality, never happened). This meeting ends in an acrimonious argument, caused by Mary's unwillingness to submit entirely to Elizabeth's wish. The argument leads to the inevitable suspicion that the cause of reprieve will not succeed.\\nTo complicate matters further, Mortimer plans to free Mary from the prison by force, a dramatized version of the unsuccessful Babington Plot, but when his attempt is found out, he commits suicide.\\nQueen Elizabeth eventually persuades herself to sign Mary's death warrant. Elizabeth insists that her only reason for signing is the pressure from her own people to do so.\\nThe signed warrant is handed to Queen Elizabeth's undersecretary Davison without any clear instructions on what to do with it. In the process, Elizabeth transfers the burden of responsibility to him, fully aware that he in turn will hand over the warrant to Lord Burleigh, and thus confirm Mary's death sentence.\\nBurleigh demands the signed document from Davison, who â\\x80\\x94 despite his uncertainty â\\x80\\x94 eventually hands it to him. As a result, Burleigh has Mary executed.\\nThe play ends with Elizabeth blaming both Burleigh and Davison for Mary's death (banishing the former from court and having the latter imprisoned in the Tower), Lord Shrewsbury (who pleaded for mercy for Mary throughout the play) resigning his honors and Leicester leaving England for France. Elizabeth is left completely alone as the curtain falls.\", 'tokens': array(['Mary', 'Stuart', 'is', 'imprisoned', 'in', 'England', 'â\\x80\\x94',\n",
